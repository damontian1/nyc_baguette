# NYC Baguette :cake: 
NYC Baguette is the name of our fictitious bakery. We modelled our business after Paris Baguette, a chain of bakeries with multiple locations. This project was created by Christine Chan and Damon Tian. The goal of this project was to create a fully featured website for a business using Sinatra. The requirements were: at least 4 separate pages, use of photographs, use of jQuery and JavaScript for interaction, and the option to contact the business using  a form. 

## Usage
######First install gems by running:
    bundle install
######Then to start up locally, just run:
    ruby main.rb
